# The Data Interactive Plugin API

## Introduction

This document is intended to aid developers of CODAP Data Interactive Plugins.
It describes the API by which Data Interactives interact with their CODAP
host environment and send data for presentation by other CODAP components.

### About Data Interactive Plugins

Data Interactive Plugins are a class of components that may be employed
in a CODAP workspace.
Their role is to provide to CODAP data for analysis.
For example, [Data Games](http://app.codap.concord.org/interactives/)
are Data Interactives that export to CODAP the internal data generated
during the execution of simple video games.
By analyzing this data students can learn how
to improve his or her performance in the game.
The [Inquiry Space project](http://concord.org/projects/inquiryspace)
created
[a number of Data Interactives](http://lab.concord.org/interactives.html)
for sensor- or simulation-based investigation of the physical world.
A student can perform an experiment and then export the data he or she
created to CODAP for immediate analysis.

Data Interactives are loosely coupled with CODAP. They can be considered to be
plug-ins in this respect.
They need not have the same origin web server as the CODAP instance in which
they are run.
They are contained in IFrames and communicate with the CODAP engine through
PostMessage-based transport.

### About IFramePhone

The Data Interactives API uses
[IFramePhone](https://github.com/concord-consortium/iframe-phone) as a transport
library to implement communication between an installed Data Interactive and
CODAP.
IFramePhone is a wrapper for the PostMessage API. It simplifies the
establishment of the connection and implements a simple remote procedure call
 (RPC) interface.

CODAP defines command object structures and response object structures
that are passed through the IFramePhone connectors to the CODAP instance.
In most cases, the Data Interactive initiates a command and passes a callback
to receive the response object.
Some commands are initiated from the CODAP side. The mechanics of IFramePhone
interchange are the same in either case.

### Definitions

  * **Case:** An individual record or relation.
  Cases have attributes.
  * **Attribute:** A field of a Case record.
  Cases of a given Collection all have the same set of Attributes.
  * **Collection:** A set of Cases with the same set of Attributes. Typically,
  Data Interactives will define a parent and a child Collection where zero, one,
  or many child Cases are associated with each parent case and exactly one
  parent case associate with each child case.
  * **Data Context** A set of collections. Data contexts define a chain of
  parent/child relationships among collections. There can be any number of
  collections in a data context. A typical data interactive will interact
  with a single data context. In CODAP a Data Context is synonymous with a
  data set.

## API Overview

### About Data Interactive-CODAP Communication Patterns

CODAP is oriented to the handling of hierarchically structured data.
Often, the hierarchy is a natural consequence of the repetition of a
process in the Data Interactive. For example, in scientific data
interactives, the hierarchy will come about from the repetition of an
experiment.
The parent collections will describe the overall conditions and
parameters of experiments, and the child collections,
the samples taken during the execution of each experiment.
Similarly, game Data Interactives are built on the natural repetitions built
into game play.
A game Data Interactive will have parent collections that represent the
conditions and outcomes of the games,
and the child collections will describe the moves or other events that occurred
during the play of an individual game.
The execution of such a program will be like this:

  * Set up environment
  * In a loop repeat:
    * Begin an experiment (or game)
    * Collect experimental samples (or game moves)
    * Conclude experiment (or game)

A Data Interactive following the above pattern would look like this:

  * *Set up environment*
    * Initialize IFramePhone connection
    * Find out if the interactive has saved prior state by getting the
    interactiveFrame.
    * Set the desired layout in CODAP by updating the interactiveFrame
    * Establish the structure of the data by creating a data context. This
     call will create collections and attributes.
  * *In a loop repeat*:
    * *Begin an experiment (or game)*
      * Call *openCase* to create the parent case.
        In the callback, fetch and store the case id.
    * *Collect experimental samples (or game moves)*
      * Call *createCase* to create a child case for each sample or game move.
    * *Conclude experiment (or game)*
      * Call *closeCase* to close the parent case.

Other patterns of interaction are possible, but the above pattern occurs pretty
regularly.

### Required Dependencies

This API requires the
[IFramePhone Library](https://github.com/concord-consortium/iframe-phone.git).
It may be included in your HTML page, like this:
```html

<script src="js/iframe-phone.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```
There are no other dependencies for a Data Interactive.
The Data Interactive will be placed in an IFrame and will be a draggable,
resizable component within the CODAP workspace.

### Establishing a IFramePhone link to CODAP

As soon as possible during the initialization process of the javascript you
should initiate a communication link with the CODAP application.
This permits exchange of messages between the Data Interactive and CODAP.
Like this:

```javascript
this.codapPhone = new iframePhone.IframePhoneRpcEndpoint(
  doCommandHandler, "data-interactive", window.parent);
```

Arguments:

  * handler: a function to respond to commands initiated from CODAP, see, [CODAP-Initiated Actions](#codap-initiated-actions).
  * name: a string identifying the Data Interactive to CODAP. The value **must** be "data-interactive".
  * target: the parent element. Generally you will pass *window.parent*.

Returns: an IFramePhone instance. This object has a method, *call*,
that is used to issue commands to CODAP.

When CODAP activates a connection it will send this message to the Data Interactive: `{message: "codap-present"}`. This message is an historical artifact and doesn't conform to the pattern of requests and replies subsequently exchanged. It can, however, be taken as an indication that the communication is active.

### Names, IDs, and Titles

CODAP has a two parallel schemes for referencing objects. Data Interactives may
refer to objects by the value of their 'name' property. Data Interactives will
generally specify the value of this property and are responsible for its
uniqueness within its scope. Internally, CODAP will also assign an 'id'
property and will use these values in references. The purpose of this dual
naming is to facilitate the writing of data interactives without having to
deal with the complexities of chaining asynchronous requests.
Plugins can generally use either the 'name' property or the 'id' property in
a resource clause of a request.

Generally, objects will be required to be created with names and these names
are immutable once created. Names should be composed of letters, digits,
or underscores, with the initial character being a letter. Often
objects will also define a 'title' property.
Titles are generally mutable. Titles are arbitrary strings. The title is
employed where ever the object is referred to in the user interface, but, if
absent, the name will be used.

An important exception to this rule is the Attribute.
This is for historical reasons.
Attribute names are mutable through the UI.
Attribute names are displayed in the Case Table and graphs.

### Collections and Cases versus Items

CODAP presents a hierarchical view of a data set. A data set may have multiple
collections organized in series. Each collection has a set of cases and cases
in a superordinate collection are related to one or more cases (called child
cases) in the immediate subordinate collection. Every case in a subordinate
collection is related to exactly one parent case in the collection's immediately
superordinate collection.

This collections and cases view of a data set is engrained deeply in CODAP and
is the Data Interactive API primarily supports this view. However, there is
another view of data that has limited support through this API, that of Data Items.
You can think of a Data Item as the union of attributes of a case in the
most subordinate collection with the attributes of each of its ancestor cases.
For example, using JSON object syntax to describe cases, if you have two
collections, and a case in the parent collection has attributes:
```json
{ "Mfr": "Chevrolet", "Model": "Equinox" }
```
and a child case has:
```json
{ "Year": 20016, "MSRP": 23100 }
```
Then the corresponding item has the attributes of the parent case and the child
case, as follows:
```json
{ "Mfr": "Chevrolet", "Model": "Equinox", "Year": 20016, "MSRP": 23100 }
```

From the perspective of the Data Interactive, there can be several benefits to this
view of data. If the data interactive is creating data and
adding it to a data set in CODAP, it can be simpler to create items than it is to
manage cases in a collection hierarchy. A CODAP user can reorganize the collection
hierarchy, unless specifically prevented by the Data Interactive owning the
data set. If the Data Interactive is only adding items, it permit this sort of
reorganization.

Note: At this moment, creation is the only operation supported for data items.

### The Structure of Messages

Request objects, generally, are JSON objects with 'action', 'resource',
and 'values' properties. This is true whether the request was initiated by the
Data Interactive or by CODAP. They look like this:

```json
{
  "action": "create",
  "resource": "component",
  "values": {
    "type": "graph",
    "name": "myGraph",
    "dimensions": {"width": 320, "height": 240},
    "xAttributeName": "Age",
    "yAttributeName": "Height"
  }
}
```
 * **action**: one of 'create', 'update', 'get', 'delete', or
 'notify'

  * *create* requests the creation of a resource in CODAP
  * *update* requests a modification of a resource in CODAP
  * *get* requests a facsimile of a resource from CODAP
  * *delete* requests the removal of a resource from CODAP
  * *notify* informs CODAP or the DI of an event, possibly providing identifying
  information about resources involved in the event.

 * **resource**: selects a resource or collection of resources. Resource selectors
 are strings.

 * **values**: An object or an array. For the 'create' action, passes one or
 more instances of the named object. For update, passes an object fragment
with changed values.

Generally, 'create', 'update', and 'notify' requests require a 'values' property, and
'get' and 'delete' requests do not.

Response objects look like this:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "values": {

  }
}
```

  * **success**: a boolean indicating whether the action completed successfully.
  * **values**: Optional.

Generally, a success value will always be provided. 'Create' requests will
return identifying information about the objects created. 'Get' requests will
return a copy of the current state of the object. It will have a high degree
of resemblance to the corresponding section of a CODAP document. Responses to
'update', 'delete', or 'notify' requests will generally not contain a 'values'
property.

If an action fails, the "success" property will be set to false. An error message
may be present, as follows:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "values": {
    "error": "Unknown message type: xxx"
  }
}
```

Often the API provides a list resource parallel to the principal object types.
These are, naturally enough, named by appending 'List' to the base type. For
example, the list resource for the DataContext base type is DataContextList
and the list resource for the Attribute base type is AttributeList. List
resources are provided as as a basic query capability. They generally only
support the 'get' action, and they will return only identifying properties
of the objects.

#### Compound requests

Requests from data interactives to CODAP may be combined into an array. They
will be processed in the order they appear in the array. CODAP will return an
array of return objects one for each request object and in order. For example,

Send:
```json
  [{
    "action": "update",
    "resource": "interactiveFrame",
    "values": {
      "title": "DI-API Test",
      "version": "0.1",
      "preventBringToFront": false,
      "dimensions": {
        "width": 600,
        "height": 500
      }
    }
  },{
    "action": "get",
    "resource": "interactiveFrame"
  }]
```

Receive:
```json
  [{
    "success": true
  },{
    "success": true,
    "values": {
      "title": "DI-API Test",
      "version": "0.1",
      "dimensions": {
        "width": 600,
        "height": 500
      }
    }
  }]
```

### Data Types and Typeless Data

CODAP makes an effort to be flexible about data types.
It will attempt to determine the most appropriate interpretation of the data-type
for the context in which it is presented regardless of how it was introduced
to CODAP. Here are the data types CODAP currently understands:

  * Numeric: Basically, integers or positive or negative decimal numbers. Numeric data
    may be sent to CODAP as Javascript numbers or as numeric strings. General the
    English/US interpretation of numeric strings is applied. Periods are interpreted as
    decimal points. Commas as grouping separators are not recognized, nor, are commas
    as decimal points, as is the interpretation in continental Europe.
  * Date: Dates or date/times. Generally, these are received by CODAP as strings.
    ISO dates or typical US date formats are generally recognized. Recognized US
    date formats include ```dd-mmm-yyyy```, ```dd-mmm-yy```, ```mm/dd/yy```,
    ```mm/dd/yyyy``` (where ‘mmm' is three letter month *string* and ‘mm’ is
    one or two digit month *number*. For example 22-may-2016 or 05/22/16.)
    US time formats recognise ```hh:mm```, ```hh:mm:ss```, ```hh:mm:ss.ddd```.
    ```AM``` or ```PM``` may be applied. If omitted, times will be interpretted
    as 24hour times. Times are recognised as a part of a date/time string, but
    not recognized independently. ISO date
    formats include: ```yyyy-mm-dd```, ```yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss```,
    ```yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss```, but not ```yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm```. Time zones are not
    understood.
* Nominal: Strings that don't look like numbers or dates are interpreted to have
  this data type. Boolean values are also classified as Nominal.
* Color: CODAP recognizes strings as colors if they conform to CSS syntax for
  rgb, rgba, or hex colors.

### Drag and Drop of Attributes

You can drag attributes from a plugin to the CODAP main page under certain
circumstances. This is useful for plugins that wish to permit the users to
configure the axes of a graph, for example. To do this, the plugin must have the
same origin as the CODAP instance (this is a browser enforced limitation.) You
must also specify a special data transfer mime type in the DragStart handler.
In this case, the mime type will carry data needed for CODAP to determine the
attribute. It must be "application/x-codap-attr-xxx", where "xxx" is replaced
with the id of the attribute that you have previously retrieved from CODAP. Like:

```javascript
  dataTransfer.setData('application/x-codap-attr-' + id, id)
```
The value of is of this datatransfer item is not consulted, only the type.

## Data Interactive-Initiated Actions

The command-specific arguments are documented by example in the sections
below.

### InteractiveFrames

Used to pass information relevant to the embedding of the interactive's iFrame in CODAP.
The 'create' action is not supported, because, the frame will have already been created
for the Data Interactive to exist.

**Supported Actions**: update, get, notify

**Resource Selector Patterns**:

  * _'interactiveFrame'_ (update, get, notify)

#### The interactiveFrame object

```
{
  name: /* {String} The name of the interactive frame, will be synthesized by codap from the data interactive url. */
  title: /* {String} Settable and modifiable by the interactive, that will appear in the interactive's titlebar */
  version: /* {String} Settable and modifiable by the interactive, that will appear right-justified in the interactive's titlebar */
  dimensions: { /* Defines the dimensions of the interactive's screen real estate. */
    width: {Number} in pixels,
    height: {Number} in pixels
  },
  preventBringToFront: {Boolean} /* If true, prevents the data interactive
    from coming to the foreground upon selection. This may be desirable to allow
    graphs to be superimposed above the interactive. */
  preventDataContextReorg: {Boolean} /* If true, prevents the default data set for the data interactive
    from being reorganized in ways that the data interactive is unprepared to handle. For example, prevents
    operations that would create new collections or remove collections in the data set. */
  externalUndoAvailable: {Boolean} /* Indicates to the interactive that the current CODAP mode supports
    undo and can manage
    undo for the Data Interactive. See Undo topics elsewhere in this document. READONLY for the interactive. */
  standaloneUndoModeAvailable: {Boolean} /* Indicates to the interactive that CODAP is running in a mode that
    hides CODAP Undo and Redo buttons. If the interactive needs coordinated undo services and can provide
    controls, it should manage the initiation of Undo and Redo through the UndoButtonPress and RedoButtonPress
    notifications to CODAP. READONLY for the interactive. */
  cannotClose: {Boolean} /* if true, removes the close component control in the
    right corner of the component title bar. */
  isResizable: { /* If false, the user will not be able to change the flagged dimension. Defaults to true. */
    width: {Boolean}
    height: {Boolean}
  }
  savedState: /* {object} Content determined by data interactive, having been
   saved in a prior response to CODAP interactiveFrame request. READONLY for the interactive. */
}
```
#### Interactive Frame Notifications

Notifications are the means by which the plugin communicates transient
occurrence that CODAP may wish to, or even _should_, respond to.

Notification values:
  * dirty: true

      The user has altered the internal state of the plugin, so its state is no
      longer what was last reported to CODAP.

  * image: data url

    Communicates a snapshot image of the plugin.

  * request: action

    The plugin would like CODAP to initiate a change in the UI that can neither
    be captured by a component update nor a data operation. E.g. a request to
    invoke a toolbar button.

    possible requests:
      * "openGuideConfiguration": requests that CODAP open the Guide
        Configuration Dialog
      * "indicateBusy": requests that CODAP disable inputs and provide an
        indication of ongoing activity (e.g. a splash screen or wait cursor).
      * "indicateIdle": requests that CODAP remove its busy indication.
  * cursorMode: requests that the busy indicator be a wait cursor and not a
    splash screen.

#### Example: Update Interactive Frame

Send:
```json
{
  "action": "update",
  "resource": "interactiveFrame",
  "values": {
    "name": "Tester",
    "title": "DI-API Test",
    "version": "0.1",
    "preventBringToFront": false,
    "preventDataContextReorg": false,
    "cannotClose": true,
    "dimensions": {
      "width": 600,
      "height": 500
    }
  }
}
```

Receive:
```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

#### Example: Get Interactive Frame

Send:
```json
{
  "action": "get",
  "resource": "interactiveFrame"
}
```

Receive:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "values": {
    "name": "Tester",
    "title": "DI-API Test",
    "version": "0.1",
    "preventBringToFront": false,
    "preventDataContextReorg": false,
    "dimensions": {
      "width": 600,
      "height": 500
    },
    "externalUndoAvailable": true,
    "standaloneUndoModeAvailable": false
  }
}
```

#### Example: Notify Interactive Frame is dirty

Notifies CODAP that a change has occurred causing the plugin to be dirty. If
auto-save is enabled, this will trigger an autosave. As a normal part of the
document save process, CODAP will request the plugin's state and incorporate it
into the current CODAP document.

Send:
```json
{
  "action": "notify",
  "resource": "interactiveFrame",
  "values": {
    "dirty": true
  }
}
```

Receive:
```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

#### Example: Notify Interactive Frame has screenshot

Notifies CODAP that a snapshot of the plugin's state is available, and passes
that image. Image is expected to be a base64 data url with content type image/png or image/gif.

Send:
```json
{
  "action": "notify",
  "resource": "interactiveFrame",
  "values": {
    "image": "data:image/png;base64,alksdfjaslkdjf=="
  }
}
```

Receive:

```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

#### Example: Request Guide Configuration Menu

Requests that CODAP display the Guide Configuration dialog.

Send:

```json
{
  "action": "notify",
  "resource": "interactiveFrame",
  "values": {
    "request": "openGuideConfiguration"
  }
}
```

Receive:

```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

#### Example: Request Busy Indication

Requests that CODAP display an indication of non-interruptable activity, by
default, the splash screen. This command will lock out user activity until the
plugin requests 'indicateIdle', then the busy indication will be removed. It is
the responsibility of the plugin to request 'indicateIdle'.

For a Splash screen indication, send:

```json
{
  "action": "notify",
  "resource": "interactiveFrame",
  "values": {
    "request": "indicateBusy"
  }
}
```

For a translucent screen with a wait cursor, send:

```json
{
  "action": "notify",
  "resource": "interactiveFrame",
  "values": {
    "request": "indicateBusy",
    "cursorMode": true
  }
}
```

Receive:

```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

#### Example: Request Idle Indication

Requests that CODAP restore its normal view and normal interaction, removing the
translucent screens that block user interaction.

Send:

```json
{
  "action": "notify",
  "resource": "interactiveFrame",
  "values": {
    "request": "indicateIdle"
  }
}
```

Receive:

```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

### DataContexts

Specifies the properties of the set of collections that are organized in a
hierarchy. An interactive may create more than one data context. A data context
will be created by default for each data interactive at the time it is first
requested. The default data context can be referred to by the name _dataContext_
without brackets.

The API permits a plugin to create a Data Context from a URL referencing a
data set that CODAP can interpret. Most often, this data set is a CSV formatted
or tab-delimited text file. CODAP will infer the structure of the data set from
the data it reads in. In the case of a CSV or tab-delimited text file, CODAP
assumes that file is structured as a flat, non-hierarchical, data set and that
the first line contains the names of the attributes.

**Supported Actions**: create, update, get, delete

**Resource Selector Patterns**:

* _dataContext_ (for create action or to refer to Data Interactive's default
  data context for update, get, and delete actions)
* _dataContext[name]_ (update, get, delete, notify)
* _dataContextList_ (get list)
  * _dataContextByURL_ (create)

#### The dataContext object
```
{
  values: {
    name: /* {String} A unique string by which the interactive will refer to
            this data context. Once set, is cannot be changed.*/
    title: /* {String} Optional string to be used as the title of the case table
            for this data context. If not provided, _name_ will be displayed.*/
    description: /* {String} Currently not used but may be displayed in the future. */
    collections: /* {Object} Collections contained by the data context. (See
            below for object definition. ) */
  }
}
```

#### Example: Create Data Context

Notes:
  * The collections for a data context can be created with this command simply
    by providing the collection object in the values property of the request.
    See below for the structure of the collection object.
  * If there is already a data context present in the document a new data context
    with that name will not be made. Instead, the result will contain information
    about the existing data context.

Send:
```json
{
  "action": "create",
  "resource": "dataContext",
  "values": {
    "name": "DataSet",
    "title": "A data set about people",
    "collections": [ {
      "name": "People",
      "title": "Data about People",
      "labels": {
        "singleCase": "person",
        "pluralCase": "people"
      },
      "attrs": [
        { "name": "Name" },
        { "name": "Age", "type": "numeric", "precision": 0 }
      ]
    }]
  }
}
```


Receive:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "values": {
    "name": "DataSet",
    "id": 17,
    "title": "A data set about people"
  }
}
```
#### Example: create dataContext from URL

Notes:
* To succeed the URL must be configured to allow foreign origin requests.
* As noted above, the URL would usually point to a CSV or tab-delimited file.

Send:
```json
{
  "action": "create",
  "resource": "dataContextFromURL",
  "values": {
    "URL": "https://ed-public-download.apps.cloud.gov/downloads/Most-Recent-Cohorts-Scorecard-Elements.csv"
  }
}
```

Receive:
```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

#### Example: Update Data Context

Notes:
  * The data context name, once created, cannot be changed.
  * Although collections can be created through the above 'create' action, they
    cannot be updated through this dataContext 'update' action. Use the
    'update operation of the 'collection' object.

Send:
```json
{
  "action": "update",
  "resource": "dataContext[DataSet]",
  "values": {
    "title": "A new title for the data set"
  }
}
```

Receive:
```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

#### Example: Update Data Context causing rerandomization

Notes:
  * A data context may contain formulas that make use of functions that produce random values. Such data contexts may form the bases of a simulation. In such situations, a plugin can cause the data context's formulas to be re-evaluated, generating new random values. It does so by passing a `rerandomize` property with a value of `true` in an update. In response CODAP will re-evaluate all formulas that depend on functions that produce random values. It will do this once. If there are no such formulas, the update will have no effect.
  * The value of `rerandomize` is treated as "truthy" or "falsy," thus values of 1 and 0 will be treated the same as `true` and `false`.

Send:
```json
{
  "action": "update",
  "resource": "dataContext[DataSet]",
  "values": {
    "rerandomize": true
  }
}
```

Receive:
```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

#### Example: Delete Data Context

Notes:

  * The named data context will be removed from CODAP with all its
    collections and their associated attributes and case data.

Send:
```json
{
  "action": "delete",
  "resource": "dataContext[DataSet]"
}
```

Receive:
```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

#### Example: Get Data Context

Notes:

  * The get operation will return an object that contains any collections
    defined for the dataContext, and the collection attributes, but will not
    contain any case data.

Send:
```json
{
  "action": "get",
  "resource": "dataContext[DataContext1]"
}
```
Receive:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "values": {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "DataCard2",
    "title": "A new title for the data set",
    "collections": [ {
      "name": "People",
      "title": "Data about People",
      "labels": {
        "singleCase": "person",
        "pluralCase": "people"
      },
      "attrs": [
        { "name": "Name" },
        { "name": "Age", "type": "numeric", "precision": 0 }
      ]
    }]
  }
}
```
#### Example: Get Data Context List

Notes:

  * Will return identifying properties for each dataContext.

Send:
```json
{
  "action": "get",
  "resource": "dataContextList"
}
```

Receive:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "values": [ {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "DataSet2",
    "title": "A new title for the data set"
  },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "name": "DataSet3",
      "title": "Another title for the data set"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Example: set aside cases

Send:

```json
{
  "action": "notify",
  "resource": "dataContext[Mammals]",
  "values": {
    "request": "setAside",
    "caseIDs": [
      13,
      14
    ]
  }
}
```

Receive:

```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

#### Example: restore set-aside cases

Send:

```json
{
  "action": "notify",
  "resource": "dataContext[Mammals]",
  "values": {
    "request": "restoreSetasides"
  }
}
```

Receive:

```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

#### Example: Sort attribute
Notes:
  * `isDescending` is an optional property, and if absent, will assume sort is ascending.
  * `attr` can be either the attribute name or the attribute id.

Send:

```json
{
  "action": "update",
  "resource": "dataContext[Mammals]",
  "values": {
    "sort": {
      "attr": "Order",
      "isDescending": true
    }
  }
}
```

Receive:

```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

### Collections

A collection is a set of cases with a particular group of attributes. A
collection is a part of a Data Context. It may have a parent collection and/or a
child collection. If it has a parent collection, then each of its cases will
have exactly one parent case in the parent collection. If it has a child
collection, then each member case will have some number of child cases in the
child collection.

**Supported Actions**: create, update, get, delete

**Resource Selector Patterns**:
  * _'collection'_ (create)<sup>1</sup>
  * _'collection[name]'_ (update, get, delete)<sup>1</sup>
  * _'collectionList'_ (get list)<sup>1</sup>
  * _'dataContext[name].collection'_ (create)
  * _'dataContext[name].collection[name]'_ (update, get, delete)
  * _'dataContext[name].collectionList'_ (get list)

<sup>1</sup> Pattern applies to default data context

#### The collection object

```
{
    "name": /* {String} A unique string by which the interactive will refer to
                this collection. Once set, is cannot be changed.*/,
    title: /* {String} Optional string to be used as the title of this
                collection as reflected in the case table*/,
    description: /* {String} Currently not used but may be displayed in the
                future.*/,
    parent: /* {String} Name of parent collection. The parent collection should
                have been created before it can be referred to. If no parent is
                provided, the collection will be appended as the last collection
                in the collection list. "_root_" is a reserved name. It
                designates that this collection should be created as the parent
                collection to the current parent collection. */
    attrs:/* {[Object]} Optional array of attribute objects. The attribute
                object is defined below.*/,
    labels: /* {Object} Each of these fields is optional. */
    	singleCase: /* {String} used to refer to a single case. E.g. 'observation'*/,
    	pluralCase: /* {String} used to refer to more than one case. E.g. 'observations'*/,
    	singleCaseWithArticle: /* {String} showing how to prefix with an article. E.g. 'an observation'*/,
    	setOfCases: /* {String} used to refer to a group of cases. E.g. 'experiment'*/,
    	setOfCasesWithArticle: /* {String} showing how to prefix a set of cases with an article. E.g. 'an experiment'*/
}
```

#### Example: collection create

Notes:

  * Collection name must be unique within the data context.
  * Collection attributes can be specified within this request or, later, in a
    separate request.
  * A collection hierarchy is a strict hierarchy, so each collection can have
    at most one parent and child and every collection for a data context is
    in the hierarchy with no cycles.
  * The example creates a collection for the default data context.
  * If no parent is specified and the Data Context already has collections, then
    the new collection's parent will be the last collection in the collection list.
  * If "_root_" is specified for the parent property, the collection will be created
    as the root collection of the hierarchy: the ancestor of all other collections.
  * The values property can contain either a single collection or an array of
    collections. If an array is specified, they should be ordered first parent
    to last child. The example shows a hierarchy with two collections,
    "People" and "Measurements". "Measurements is a child collection of
    "People."

Send:
```json
{
  "action": "create",
  "resource": "collection",
  "values": [{
      "name": "People",
      "title": "Data about People",
      "labels": {
        "singleCase": "person",
        "pluralCase": "people"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "Measurements",
      "title": "Measurements",
      "parent": "People"
    }
  ]
}
```

Receive:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "values": [
    {
      "id": 35,
      "name": "People"
    },
    {
      "id": 36,
      "name": "Measurements"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Example: collection update

Notes:
  * The collection name, once created, cannot be changed.
  * The 'update' action cannot be used to update the collection parent.
  * The 'update' action of collection should not be used to update the
  attribute definitions. If, for example, you need to add one or more additional
  attributes you should perform a [create action on the collection's attribute
  resource](#example-attribute-create). If you need to delete an attribute or
  change its properties you would perform a [delete](#example-attribute-delete)
  or [update](#example-attribute-update) attribute operation.
  * Only one object can be updated per request.

Send:
```json
{
  "action": "update",
  "resource": "dataContext[DataCard2].collection[People]",
  "values": {
    "title": "Students",
    "labels": {
      "singleCase": "student",
      "pluralCase": "students"
    }
  }
}
```

Receive:
```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

#### Example: collection get

Send:
```json
{
  "action": "get",
  "resource": "dataContext[DataCard2].collection[People]"
}
```

Receive:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "values": {
    "id": 3,
    "name": "People",
    "title": "Students",
    "labels": {
      "singleCase": "student",
      "pluralCase": "students"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Example: collection delete

* If a collection is deleted, all its attributes will also be deleted.

Send:
```json
{
  "action": "delete",
  "resource": "dataContext[DataCard].collection[People]"
}
```

Receive:
```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

#### Example: collection list get

Send:
```json
{
  "action": "get",
  "resource": "dataContext[DataCard2].collectionList"
}
```

Receive:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "values": [
      {
        "id": 45,
        "name": "People",
        "title": "People"
      },
      {
        "id": 46,
        "name": "Measurements",
        "title": "Measurements"
      }
  ]
}
```

### Attributes

Attributes are typed properties of cases.
They may be numeric or categorical (numbers or strings).

**Supported Actions**: create, update, get, delete

**Resource Selector Patterns**:
  * _'collection[name].attribute'_ (create)<sup>1</sup>
  * _'collection[name].attribute[name]'_ (update, get, delete)<sup>1</sup>
  * _'collection[name].attributeList'_ (get list)<sup>1</sup>
  * _'dataContext[name].collection[name].attribute'_ (create)
  * _'dataContext[name].collection[name].attribute[name]'_ (update, get,
  delete)
  * _'dataContext[name].collection[name].attributeList'_ (get list)

<sup>1</sup> Pattern applies to default data context

#### The attribute object

```
{
    "name": /* {String}  Names must (a) be unique within the attributes of the
                    data context, and (b) be made up of letters, numbers and underscores.
                    Names which do not meet these criteria will be modified on creation to fit these
                    rules. Spaces and punctuation will be converted to underscores. */,
    "title": /* {String}. If not specified, the title of an attribute defaults to
  	                its name. */,
    "type": /* {'numeric' | 'categorical'} Optional. If not
                    specified, CODAP will decide dynamically whether to treat
                    the attribute as numeric or categorical based on the
                    presence of non-null, non-numeric values.*/,
    "colormap": /* {Object} Optional. For categorical attributes, a hashmap of values
                    to colors as hex strings. For numeric attributes, an object
                    with color assignments for the keys 'high-attribute-color',
                    'low-attribute-color', and 'attribute-color'. */
    "description": /* {String} Optional. A descriptive string that will appear
                    in the form of a tooltip in various situations
                    when user hovers over attribute name. */,
    "editable": /* {Boolean} Whether the values of the attribute can be edited by the user.
                    Defaults to true. */,
    "formula": /* {String} Optional. An expression. If present, the value of this attribute will be the
                    result of evaluation of the expression. See the rules for formatting expressions below. */,
    "hidden": /* {Boolean} Whether the attribute is hidden. Caution: use with care as there is currently
                    no UI support for managing hidden attributes from the CODAP side. */,
    "precision": /* {Number} For numeric attributes, the number of
                    digits to the right of the decimal point that will be
                    displayed in case table. Defaults to two. */,
    "unit": /* {String} Optional. The units of a numeric attribute. Displayed
                    in various places in the user interface. */
}
```

#### Attribute formula property expression formatting rules

- The whole expression should be wrapped in double-quotes
  - Correct formatting: ` "formula": "LifeSpan > 30" `
  - Incorrect formatting: ` "formula": LifeSpan > 30 `
- The names of attributes should not be wrapped in any quotation marks
  - Correct formatting: ` "formula": "LifeSpan > 30" `
  - Incorrect formatting: ` "formula": "'LifeSpan' > 30" `
- If an expression contains a value that is a string, it should be wrapped in single-quotes, or double-quotes with backwards slashes before them
  - Correct formatting:  
    - `"formula": "Diet='meat'"`
    - `"formula": "Diet==\"meat\""`
  - Incorrect formatting:
    - `"formula": "Diet=meat"`
    - `"formula": "Diet=”meat”"`
- Numerical values should not be wrapped in quotation marks
  - Correct formatting: ` "formula": "LifeSpan > 30" `
  - Incorrect formatting: ` "formula": "LifeSpan > '30'" `
- Regardless of what collection level the new attribute with its formula is being created within, any attribute being used in the formula should be referenced ONLY by its name and not its collection path (i.e. Diet, not CollectionName.Diet)
  - Correct formatting:
     ``` 
       "action": "create",
       "resource": "dataContext[Mammals].collection[Diets].attribute",
       "values": [
        {
          "name": "Average LifeSpan",
          "type": "categorical",
          "title": "Average LifeSpan",
          "description": "The average lifespan for mammals that eat this diet",
          "editable": false,
          "formula": "mean(LifeSpan)"
        }
       ]
     ```
  - Incorrect formatting:
     ``` 
       "action": "create",
       "resource": "dataContext[Mammals].collection[Diets].attribute",
       "values": [
        {
          "name": "Average LifeSpan",
          "type": "categorical",
          "title": "Average LifeSpan",
          "description": "The average lifespan for mammals that eat this diet",
          "editable": false,
          "formula": "mean(Cases.LifeSpan)"
        }
       ]
     ```


#### Example: attribute create

Notes:

  * Attribute name must be unique within the _data context_.

Send:
```json

### AttributeLocations

This resource describes the location of an attribute in a data set by collection
and position within the attribute list of the collection. It can be used to move
an attribute from one location to another within the data set.

**Supported Operation**: update

**Resource Selector Patterns**:
  * _'collection[name].attributeLocation'_ (update)
  * _'dataContext[name].collection[name].attributeLocation'_ (update)
  * _'dataContext[name].attributeLocation'_ (update)

#### The attributeLocation object

```
{
  "collection": /* name of the collection to move the attribute to or
    "parent" to move the attribute one collection up */,
  "position": /* zero indexed position of the attribute in the list of attributes
}
```

### Cases

A case is an item which can be characterized by some knowable attributes.
It may be a thing that can be measured and described, or it may be an event or
observation. A case may describe the characteristics of an aggregate or it
may be
an individual member of a larger aggregate.


**Supported Actions**: create, update, get, delete

**Resource Selector Patterns**:

  * _'dataContext[name].collection[name].case'_ (create, update)
  * _'dataContext[name].collection[name].allCases'_ (get, delete)
  * _'dataContext[name].collection[name].caseByID[id]'_ (get, update, delete)
  * _'dataContext[name].collection[name].caseByIndex[index]'_ (get, update, delete)
  * _'dataContext[name].collection[name].caseCount_ (get)
  * _'dataContext[name].collection[name].caseSearch[search-expression]'_ (get)<sup>1</sup>
  * _'dataContext[name].collection[name].caseFormulaSearch[search-expression]'_ (get)
  * _'dataContext[name].caseByID[id]'_ (get, update, delete)

<sup>1</sup> Deprecated: use caseFormulaSearch.

#### The case object

```
{
  id: /* {number} case id */
  parent: /* {String} Case selector */,
  values: /* {Object} key/value pairs, one for each attribute that gets a value.
  Key is attribute name.*/
}
```

#### Example: create case

Notes:
* You can create one or more cases this way.
* If the cases refer to a parent case, the parent must already exist.
* Cases in child collections must have a parent.

Send:
```json
{
  "action": "create",
  "resource": "dataContext[People].collection[Measurements].case",
  "values":[
    {
      "parent": 12,
      "values": {
        "SampleDate": "12/1/2015",
        "Age": 12,
        "Height": 66,
        "Favorite": "Vanilla"
      }
    }, {
      "parent": 13,
      "values": {
        "SampleDate": "12/1/2015",
        "Age": 11,
        "Height": 63,
        "Favorite": "Rocky Road"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Receive:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "values": [
    {
      "id": 15
    }, {
      "id": 16
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Example: update multiple cases by ID

Notes:
* If a referenced case doesn't exist in CODAP. This will not cause the request
  to be failed.
* If a referenced attribute doesn't exist, it will be be ignored. This will not
  cause the request to be failed.
* The response message will list the cases found and updated, even if the
  attribute was not found or an attribute value was the same as the existing value.

Send:
```json
{
  "action": "update",
  "resource": "dataContext[Mammals].collection[Mammals].case",
  "values": [
    {
      "id": 13,
      "values":  {
        "LifeSpan": 17
       }
    },
    {
      "id": 14,
      "values":  {
        "LifeSpan": 34
       }
    }
  ]
}
```

Receive:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "caseIDs": [
    13,
    14
  ]
}
```

#### Example: update case by ID

Effect: Updates a single case.

Notes:
  * Case ID is unique and sufficient within a DataContext, so 'collection[...]'
    phrase in the resource name is not required.

Send:
```json
{
  "action": "update",
  "resource": "dataContext[People].collection[People].caseByID[15]",
  "values": {
    "values": {
      "Favorite": "Chocolate"
    }
  }
}
```

Receive:
```json
{
  "success": true
}
```
#### Example: get case by index

  * Index values are numeric and range from *0* to *n-1* where *n* is the number
   of cases in the collection.
  * Cases are ordered as in the case tables: grouped so that the children of
  each parent are together. Within this group they are ordered by arrival:
  oldest cases first.

Send:
```json
{
  "action": "get",
  "resource": "dataContext[Mammals].collection[Diets].caseByIndex[0]"
}
```

Receive:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "values": {
    "case": {
      "id": 53,
      "parent": null,
      "collection": {
        "name": "Diets",
        "id": 52
      },
      "values": {
        "Diet": "plants"
      },
      "children": [ 13,14,20,21,25,36,37]
    },
    "caseIndex": 0
  }
}
```

#### Example: get case by ID

Send:
```json
{
  "action": "get",
  "resource": "dataContext[People].collection[People].caseByID[15]"
}
```
Receive:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "values": {
    "case": {
    "id": 15,
      "values": {
        "Name": "Jim",
        "Age": 15,
        "Height": 68
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Example: get case by formula search

Notes:
  * Returns the cases that satisfy a formula expression. Formula expressions in
    CODAP are used to set the values of formula attributes. The CODAP website
    has a description of the syntax: https://codap.concord.org/help/work-functions.
    All cases are returned for which the formula returns a truthy value
    (boolean true, a non-zero number, or a non-empty string).
  * All strings must be quoted and attribute names should be surrounded by
    backquotes if they contain spaces or non-ascii characters.
  * Use of this resource is preferred to the 'caseSearch' resource.

Send:
```json
{
  "action": "get",
  "resource": "dataContext[Mammals].collection[Mammals].caseFormulaSearch[Mass=max(Mass)]"
}
```

Receive:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "values": [
    {

        "Habitat": "land",
        "Diet": "plants"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
#### Example: get case by search

Notes:
  * Only simple expressions are supported of the form: `attr oper value` where
    'attr' is an attribute name, 'oper' is one of '==', '!=', '<', '>', '<=',
    or '>=', and 'value' is a numeric or string value.
  * This API endpoint is deprecated in favor of the more capable caseFormulaSearch.

### Items

Data Items are an alternate view of a data set. A data item can be thought of as a
"complete" case: the union of a leaf (rightmost) case with its ancestor cases.
That is, if you have a data set with three hierarchical collections, "A", "B", and
"C", and suppose you have a case in collection "C", then its associated Data Item
is the tuple consisting of the values of attributes this case, the values
the attributes of its parent case in collection "B" and the values of the
attributes of its grandparent case in collection "A".

Items can be accessed several ways. They can be accessed by sequential index
(resource clause: 'item'), they can be accessed by ID
(resource clause: 'itemByID'), they can be accessed by case id of a case that
refers to them (resource clause: 'caseID'), or they can be accessed by search
(resource clause: 'itemSearch').


**Supported Actions**: create, update, delete, get

**Resource Selection Patterns**:
  * _'dataContext[name].item'_ (create, update)
  * _'dataContext[name].item[index]'_ (get, update, delete)
  * _'dataContext[name].itemByID[id]'_ (get, update, delete)
  * _'dataContext[name].itemByCaseID[id]'_ (get, update, delete)
  * _'dataContext[name].itemSearch[expr]'_ (get, delete)
  * _'dataContext[name].itemCount'_ (get)

#### The item object

The item object is a map of non-formula attribute names to values. For example:

```json
{
    "Mammal": "Lion",
    "Order": "Carnivora",
    "LifeSpan": 15,
    "Height": 2.5,
    "Mass": 250,
    "Sleep": 20,
    "Speed": 80,
    "Habitat": "land",
    "Diet": "meat"
}
```

#### Example: item get by search

* Item search expressions generally have the form:
```
  attribute_name operator value
```
Where `attribute_name` is the name of an attribute,
`operator` is one of "==", "!=", "<", "<=", ">", ">=", and
`value` is a string, numerical, or boolean value, as appropriate.

* Item search also supports a wild card, `*`, that matches all items.

### SelectionLists

This API is for managing selection of cases in CODAP.

**Supported Actions**: create, update, get

**Resource Selection Patterns**:
  * _'dataContext[name].selectionList'_ (create, update, get)
  * _'selectionList'_ (create, update, get for default data context)

#### The selectionList object

The selectionList object is just an array of case ids. Cases may belong to
different collections. Selection is inherited by the children of cases, so
more cases may be displayed in CODAP after the selectionList request is sent.

```json
[
  25,
  29,
  30
]
```

#### Example: selectionList create

Send:
```json
{
  "action": "create",
  "resource": "dataContext[name].selectionList",
  "values": [
      25,
      29,
      30
  ]
}
```

Receive:
```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

#### Example: selectionList update

Notes
  * selectionList update adds to the existing selection.

Send:
```json
{
  "action": "update",
  "resource": "dataContext[name].selectionList",
  "values": [
      25,
      29,
      30
  ]
}
```

Receive:
```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

#### Example: selectionList get

Send:
```json
{
  "action": "get",
  "resource": "dataContext[name].selectionList"
}
```

Receive:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "values": [
    {
      "collectionID": 3,
      "collectionName": "Mammals",
      "caseID": 36
    },

      "caseID": 25
    }
  ]
}
```

### Components

Components are independently manipulated graphical elements in the CODAP UI.
They can be positioned and sized.
Often they present a visualization of an underlying data set.
For example, graphs, case tables, maps, and sliders are all components.

Component objects share a base set of properties that identify them and
position and size them in the UI.
They may add additional configuration properties according to their type.

The position property can specify a positioning rule ('top' or 'bottom') or
specify an explicit location.
If the former, the layout manager will place the
component so to avoid overlap with existing components.

**Supported Actions**: create, update, delete, get, notify

**Resource Selection Patterns**:
  * _'component'_ (create)
  * _'component[name]'_ (get, update, delete, notify)
  * _'component[id]'_ (get, update, delete, notify)
  * _'componentList'_ (get)

**Notifications**

A component can issue a notification to influence other components in a limited
number of ways. It can cause another component to be selected and can cause
another component (e.g. a Case Table or Graph) to autoscale. It does this by issuing
a notification specifying the target component as the resource and setting a
value of an object with a single property, 'request'. The property, 'request',
should have the value of 'select' or 'autoScale'.

    "values": [{
      "name": "gaussianFitEnabled",
      "value": "yes"
      }
    ]
}
```

### LogMessages

Tells CODAP to log a message to CODAP's Log Server. As a side effect, notifies
CODAP that the plugin's state has changed in a material way, and CODAP should
consider this state to be "dirty". If autosave is enabled for CODAP this will
trigger document save activity.

**Supported Actions**: notify

**Resource Selector Patterns**:
  * _'logMessage'_ (notify)

#### The logMessage object

```
{
  formatStr: /* Format string for the log statement. Use %@ for replaceable
  parameters. The format string follows SproutCore string format conventions,
  so %@1 can be used for specific identification. E.g. 'Launched rocket with
  %@ engine toward %@' */,
  replaceArgs: /* [*] An array of values used to replace %@ instances in
  formatStr. E.g. ['red', 'satellite']*/
}
```

#### Example: logMessage notify

  }
}
```

Receive:
```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

### UndoChangeNotices

Notifies CODAP of a Data Interactive Change relating to Undo/Redo according to the
'operation' property.

If the operation is 'undoableActionPerformed', notifies CODAP that the DI has
performed an undoable action.
This is used when the DI expects CODAP to take control over undoing and
redoing actions.
No arguments are sent, CODAP simply adds a "data interactive undoable action"
to its undo stack, and when a user clicks Undo and Redo at the appropriate
point in the stack, CODAP sends undoAction or redoAction to the DI as appropriate.
The Data Interactive is responsible for maintaining its own undo stack, CODAP
is simply responsible for initiating the undo or redo events.

If the operation is 'UndoButtonPressed', or 'RedoButtonPressed', then we assume the
data interactive has an undo or redo button and this is a notice of a user event
on this control. CODAP will respond to this event by performing the action as if
its own undo or redo button had been pressed.

CODAP replies will include a brief summary of the state of the undo and redo stacks.
If there is an undoable action on the undo stack, codap replies will report
"canUndo" as true. Likewise, if the is a redoable action on the redo stack it
will report "canRedo" as true.

**Supported Actions**: notify

**Resource Selector Patterns**:
  * _'undoChangeNotice'_ (notify)

#### The undoChangeNotice object

```
{
  operation: /* {'undoableActionPerformed'|'undoButtonPress'|'redoButtonPress'} */,
  logMessage: /* {string} An optional log message. */
}
```

#### Example: undoChangeNotice notify

Send:
```json
{
  "action": "notify",
  "resource": "undoChangeNotice",
  "values": {
    "operation": "undoableActionPerformed",
    "logMessage": "Set focal length: 1m"
  }
}
```

Receive:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "values": {
    "canUndo": true,
    "canRedo": false
  }
}
```

#### Example: undoButtonPress notify

Send:
```json
{
  "action": "notify",
  "resource": "undoChangeNotice",
  "values": {
    "operation": "undoButtonPress"
  }
}
```

Receive:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "values": {
    "canUndo": true,
    "canRedo": false
  }
}
```

### LogMessageMonitor

When a DI registers for log messages and a log message is matched against
the parameters in the register call the DI will receive a "notify" action
on the "logMessageNotice" resource with the log message plus information
about how the log message was matched.

**Supported Actions**: `register`, `unregister`

`register` - this takes at least one of the following parameters which are used to match incoming log messages

* `topic` - matches against the topic set in the log message
* `topicPrefix` - matches against the start of the topic in the log message
* `formatStr` - matches the `formatStr` used in the log message
* `message` - matches the `formatStr` merged with the log parameters

and can take an additional optional `clientId` parameter which is an opaque value used in `unregister`

`unregister` - this takes one of the following two parameters

* `id` - the autogenerated id returned from the register call
* `clientId` - this is a opaque value provided by the client in the register call

## CODAP-Initiated Actions

The IFramePhone-based API is entirely symmetric.
It is a full duplex channel.
The mechanism for CODAP-initiated actions is the same as for
Data Interactive-initiated actions.
The request is encapsulated in a command object,
and the requester receives replies asynchronously through a callback.

The Data Interactive should register a dispatch function by providing it as an
argument when initiating IFramePhone. Like this:

```javascript
this.codapPhone = new iframePhone.IframePhoneRpcEndpoint(requestHandler,
        "data-interactive", window.parent);
```
Here, 'requestHandler' is a function that will be called to handle requests from
CODAP. As with the Data Interactive to CODAP request traffic, the payload
of the CODAP to Data Interactive requests is a serializable object of the same form.
The object will have an 'action' and 'resource' field, and may have a 'values'
field. The payload of the response from the Data Interactive should consist of a
serializable object with a 'success' field and possibly a 'values' field.

```json
{
  "action": "get",
  "resource": "interactiveState"
}
```

The form of the callback function might look like this:

```javascript
function requestHandler( iCommand, callback) {
  switch( iCommand.resource) {
    case 'interactiveState':
      if (iCommand.action = 'get') {
        callback(cartGame.model.saveState());
      } else {
        callback({"success": false});
      }
      break;
    case 'undoChangeNotice':
      // ...
      break;
    default:
      callback({"success": false});
  }
}
```
We see that the requestHandler function is passed a callback.
It should be called with the results of executing the command handler.

If the Data Interactive has persistent state,
it should implement a request handler that dispatches to implementation of
saveState function. It should implement a 'get' request to 'interactiveState'
as a part of its initialization to retrieve the state it may have previously
saved.
If it does not have persistent state,
it need not implement a request handler at this time.
The requests from CODAP will be ignored.

Likewise, if the data interactive does not support exchange of other resources,
it can ignore these actions as well.

Most actions flowing from CODAP to the data interactives are notifications. The
intent is to alert the data interactive of some event occurring in CODAP that
may be of interest to the interactive. Often, no meaningful data will
accompany the request. The interactive is expected to query further if it
requires details.

### interactiveState

The interactiveState is an arbitrary JSON object defined by the Data
Interactive. It is requested by CODAP when CODAP wishes to save the state of the
entire CODAP application. It can be retrieved by the data interactive as a
part of the interactiveState object.

**Supported Actions**: get

**Resource Selector Patterns**:

  * _'interactiveState'_ (get)

#### Example: interactiveState get

Notes:

  * Occurs when CODAP is about to save its application state as a document.
  * If the data interactive does not maintain state from one invocation to
    another it can ignore this request.

CODAP Sends:
```json
{
  "action": "get",
  "resource": "interactiveState"
}
```

Data Interactive Sends:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "values": {
  }
}
```

### undoChangeNotice

This request notifies the interactive of undo request activity. These
notifications refer to undoableActionPerformed notices sent from the
interactive to CODAP. If an interactive implements undo and/or redo and
wishes to participate in CODAP's undo/redo stack, these actions permit this.

The following notifications are possible:

  * _'undoAction'_ will be sent when a user requests undo and a previously
  registered 'undoableActionPerformed' notice from this DI is at the top
  of the undo stack.
  * _'redoAction'_ will be sent when a user requests redo and a previously
  registered 'undoableActionPerformed' notice from this DI is at the top
  of the redo stack.
  * _'clearUndo'_ will be sent when a user requests an activity that would
    break the undo stack and this DI has previously registered an
    'undoableActionPerformed' notice.
  * _'redoAction'_ will be sent when a user requests an activity that would
    break the undo stack and this DI has previously registered an
    'undoableActionPerformed' notice that has been undone.

CODAP will send an indication of the status of the undo stack. It will set the
'canUndo' property to true, iff there are undoable actions on the stack whether
they are plugin related undo actions or not. Likewise, it will set the 'canRedo',
property iff there are redoable actions on the stack.

**Supported Actions**: notify

**Resource Selector Patterns**:

  * _'undoChangeNotice'_ (notify)

#### The undoChangeNotice object

```
{
  "operation": { "undoAction" | "redoAction" | "clearUndo" | "clearRedo" },
  "canUndo": {boolean},
  "canRedo": {boolean}
}
```

#### Example: undoChangeNotice notify

CODAP Sends:
```json
{
  "action": "notify",
  "resource": "undoChangeNotice",
  "values": {
    "operation": "undoAction",
    "canUndo": true,

  }
}
```

### documentChangeNotice

This request notifies the interactive of document level activity. Examples of
such activity include the creation or destruction of globals, or

**Supported Actions**: notify

**Resource Selector Patterns**:

  * _'documentChangeNotice'_ (notify)

#### The documentChangeNotice object

```
{
  "operation": /* {string} operation name. See below */
}
```

The following operations are possible:

| Operation               | Description                                       |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| dataContextCountChanged | This count of dataContexts change, indicating addition or removal of one or more data contexts |
| dataContextDeleted      | This indicates the deletion of a data context     |
| updateDocumentBegun | CODAP has received a new document object and has begun processing and updating its current state |

### Drag and Drop Notifications

Notifications from CODAP to plugin that the user has dragged an attribute
over the plugin. Because of trust barriers and technology differences the
plugin cannot receive these events directly so they are transmitted through the
API. The plugin can handle these notifications in a manner quite similar to the
way they might handle the corresponding DOM events.

**Supported Actions**: notify

**Resource Selector Patterns**:

  * dragDrop[attribute]

**Operations**:
  * dragstart
  * dragend
  * dragenter
  * dragleave
  * drag
  * drop

#### Example: drop attribute

This is, of course the culmination of the drag operation. It occurs when the user
releases the mouse button and the pointer is over the plugin in question. Note
that the position values are pixel values in the plugin's coordinate space.

CODAP Sends:
```json
{
  "action": "notify",
  "resource": "dragDrop[attribute]",
  "values": {
    "operation": "drop",
    "text": "Order",
    "attribute": {
      "id": 25,
      "name": "Order",
      "title": "Order"
    },
    "collection": {
      "id": 24,
      "name": "Mammals",
      "title": "Mammals"
    },
    "context": {
      "id": 23,
      "name": "Mammals",
      "title": "Mammals"
    },
    "position": {
      "x": 69,
      "y": 445
    }
  }
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "success": true
}
```
